                                                                                   EVACUATION 
                              2.1.       FITNESS FOR AIR TRAVEL
                              Patients selected for transportation by air must be cleared for the proposed 
                              flight by an aeromedically trained medical officer either at the originating facility, 
                              a casualty staging unit, or an in-transit evacuation facility, or, in his absence, by 
                              another competent medical authority.                                  The medical officer must balance 
                              casualty fitness considerations against the availability of suitable in-flight 
                              medical attention; the capacity for treatment in the reception area; the 
                              operational situation; and the operational capabilities of the available airlift 
                              aircraft. 
                              2.2.       FORWARD AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION 
                              1.         In forward aeromedical evacuation, the paramount need is to transport 
                              the patient to the initial point of treatment as quickly as possible. Helicopters 
                              and V/STOL aircraft will be used for airlift. 
                              2.         The principle for the conduct of aeromedical evacuation in forward areas, 
                              including priority of movement, scheduling, decisions as to whom should be 
                              evacuated and the provision of medical escorts, is outlined in STANAG 2087 – 
                              Medical Employment of Air Transport in the Forward Area. 
                              2.3.       TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION 
                              1.         In these types of operation, the benefit to the patient of transfer to an 
                              area where appropriate medical facilities are available must be balanced 
                              against the ability of the patient to withstand the anticipated environment 
                              conditions of the flight.              Account must be taken of the effects on the prospective 
                              passenger of significant changes in atmospheric pressure and cabin 
                              temperature, turbulence, the work load on a hard-pressed in-flight medical team 
                              with restricted facilities and due regard paid to the aircraft type, flight plan and 
                              mode of flight. 
                              2.         When aeromedical evacuation is carried out with helicopters, vibration 
                              (causing resonance of damaged body structures), turbulence (causing motion 
                              sickness), noise (making communication difficult), poor temperature control and 
                              a cramped and ill-lit interior (making in-flight care less available) are all 
                              problematic.          In unpressurised fixed-wing aircraft, hypoxia and expansion of gas 
                              in bodily cavities may worsen the condition of a casualty; these problems are 
                              lessened in pressurised aircraft but not totally eliminated. 
                                                                                           2-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                              2.4.       CLINICAL SELECTION CRITERIA 
                              1.         There are no absolute contra-indications to aeromedical evacuation. 
                              Each case must be judged on its merits, weighing the advantage to the patient 
                              of transfer against the possible harmful effects of the flight.                                             Sometimes a 
                              calculated risk must be taken.                             Patients with critical medical or surgical 
                              conditions (e.g. penetrating wounds or injuries of the chest or abdomen) should 
                              be stabilised wherever possible before evacuation.                                            Unstable, or recently 
                              stabilised patients, must be provided with the highest level of care available and 
                              wherever possible should be accompanied by an anaesthetist or an intensive 
                              care physician.             As a guide it would be wise to accept the following types of 
                              patients only when there is no other acceptable means of transport: 
                                         a.         Patients in the infective stage of serious communicable diseases 
                                                    are generally not acceptable for AE.                                      If any are carried, 
                                                    appropriate precautions must be taken for the protection of other 
                                                    occupants (ref. Chapter 7). 
                                         b.         Sick and wounded whose general condition is such that they may 
                                                    not survive the flight. 
                                         c.         Patients whose upper and lower jaws are immobilised.                                                Such 
                                                    patients require constant supervision by persons who are 
                                                    competent and equipped to remove the tie materials immediately 
                                                    should the patient become airsick or vomit.                                             Fixation by 
                                                    intermaxillary elastics is preferable to wire because of ease of 
                                                    cutting. 
                                         d.         Pregnant patients who are beyond the 250                              th day of pregnancy are 
                                                    not routinely acceptable for aeromedical evacuation, but may be 
                                                    moved if determined necessary to the patient's mental and/or 
                                                    physical health by competent medical authority. 
                              2.         Patients with any of the following conditions require special consideration 
                              in selection for aeromedical evacuation, particularly in unpressurised aircraft: 
                                         a.         Respiratory embarrassment.                             Patients whose unaided vital 
                                                    capacity is less than 900 ml should not normally be moved by air 
                                                    without a mechanical respirator. 
                                         b.         Cardiac failure or early (less than 6 weeks) post-myocardial 
                                                    infarction. 
                                                                                           2-2                                 Edition A Version 1

                                                    might prove suddenly incapacitating or acutely progressive, or that

                              3.1.       CATEGORISATION OF PATIENTS
                              The system of categorising patients that is used for aeromedical evacuation 
                              provides the medical and movements staff responsible for coordinating the 
                              movement of patients with a simple means of assessing the urgency, medical 
                              support needs and space requirement of each casualty without a need to refer 
                              to detailed clinical information which may not be readily available.                                          Indeed such 
                              medical information should be treated in strict confidence and a classification 
                              system can aid in this.                Codes are allocated to patients for Priority, Dependency 
                              and Classification. 
                              3.2.       PRIORITY 
                              Patients for aeromedical evacuation will be given appropriate degrees of priority 
                              so that, if aircraft space is limited, the more urgent patients may be evacuated 
                              before those whose conditions are less serious.                                 The degrees of priority are: 
                                         a.         Priority 1/URGENT                 .     Emergency patients for whom speedy 
                                                    evacuation is necessary to save life, to prevent complications, or 
                                                    to avoid serious permanent disability. (NTM for TacAE <3 hrs, for 
                                                    StratAE <12 hrs) 
                                         b.         Priority 2/PRIORITY               .   Patients who require specialised treatment 
                                                    not available locally and who are liable to deteriorate unless 
                                                    evacuated with the least possible delay. (NTM for TacAE <12 hrs, 
                                                    for StratAE 12-24 hrs) 
                                         c.         Priority 3/ROUTINE                 .    Patients whose immediate treatment is 
                                                    available locally but whose prognosis would benefit from air 
                                                    evacuation on routine scheduled flights. (NTM for TacAE >12 hrs, 
                                                    for StratAE >24 hrs) 
                              3.3.       DEPENDENCY 
                              The assessment of dependency recognises the need to move patients who 
                              have been stabilised but whose condition remains unstable, possibly requiring 
                              intensive support in flight.                The degrees of dependency are: 
                                                                                           3-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                                                    intensive support during flight.                       For example, patients requiring 
                                                    ventilation, monitoring of central venous pressure and cardiac 
                                                    monitoring.             They may be unconscious or under general 
                                                    anaesthesia. 
                                         b.         Dependency 2 – Medium Dependency                                   .  Patients who, although 
                                                    not      requiring         intensive          support,         require        regular,         frequent 
                                                    monitoring and whose condition may deteriorate in flight.                                              For 
                                                    example,           patients         who        have        a     combination             of     oxygen 
                                                    administration, one or more intravenous infusions and multiple 
                                                    drains or catheters. 
                                         c.         Dependency 3 – Low Dependency                               .  Patients whose condition is 
                                                    not expected to deteriorate during flight but who require nursing 
                                                    care of, for example, simple oxygen therapy, an intravenous 
                                                    infusion or a urinary catheter.

                                                    require nursing attention in flight but who might need assistance 
                                                    with mobility or bodily functions. 
                              3.4.       CLASSIFICATION 
                              The classification defines the patient's requirement for space in the aircraft and 
                              for physical assistance.                In addition it describes any requirement for the physical 
                              restraint or supervision of psychiatric patients. 
                                         a.         Class 1 – Neuropsychiatric Patients                           :

                                   CHAPTER 7                   MANAGEMENT OF CHEMICALLY CONTAIMINATED OR 
                                                                HIGHLY INFECTIOUS CASUALTIES 
                              7.1.       CHEMICALLY CONTAMINATED CASUALTIES 
                              1.         Patients will normally not be evacuated by air in a chemically 
                              contaminated state.                Decontamination is accomplished at the first point of care 
                              and not expected as part of aeromedical evacuation crew duties. 
                              2.         If contamination status cannot be fully ascertained or there is a fear of 
                              the patient 'off gassing' in flight, a risk assessment should be undertaken to 
                              determine the necessity of evacuating the patient by air; potential hazards to 
                              other passengers or patients, to aircrew and to medical personnel and the 
                              impact of potentially removing an airframe from service to be decontaminated, 
                              should all be taken into account. 
                              3.         Once the risks have been assessed and a decision has been made to 
                              evacuate a potentially contaminated casualty by air, the risk must then be 
                              mitigated to the greatest extent possible. Such protective measures could 
                              include individual protective equipment and casualty barrier devices (bags or 
                              wraps). 
                              7.2.       PATIENTS WITH HIGHLY COMMUNICABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES 
                              1.         Every patient being considered for evacuation by air should be assessed 
                              for infectious potential and handled in accordance with standard infectious 
                              disease precautions (such as: body waste cleanup, containment and disposal; 
                              hand-washing; barriers and protective clothing).                                   However, depending on the 
                              threat situation, there are special circumstances that require more extraordinary 
                              measures to ensure not only patient and medical crew welfare and protection, 
                              but also force protection and population health. 
                              2.         To assist those responsible for aeromedical evacuation of casualties in 
                              the assessment of highly communicable infectious diseases that may present 
                              special considerations for aeromedical evacuation, Annexes B and C may be 
                              helpful in determining the level of containment required when evacuating highly 
                              infectious patients. 
                              3.         When, by whatever method, suspicion is high that the patient(s) being 
                              considered for aeromedical evacuation might have a highly communicable 
                              infectious disease, there are extraordinary issues to be considered and, if 
                              evacuated by air, special measures to be taken.                                            If it is determined that 
                                                                                           7-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                              to be considered are as follows: 
                                         a.         Risk to other patients, aircrew and medical crew (consider immune 
                                                    status and suitability of chemoprophylaxis for the tasked crew). 
                                         b.         Capability to properly isolate and safely provide care. 
                                         c.         Risk to population at destination, along planned flight legs and 
                                                    possible emergency diversions (disease suspected vs. population

                                         e.         Impact on mission (dedication of significant resources which 
                                                    detract from other medical mission considerations).

                                                    communicable infectious diseases. 
                                         i.         Numbers of patients suspected of being infected. 
                                         j.         Contact tracing should a highly communicable disease emerge 
                                                    after evacuation. 
                              4.         Decision to evacuate patient(s) suspicious for or confirmed to have a 
                              highly communicable infectious disease may be made on other than medical 
                              reasons.          The issues mentioned here allow the responsible medical team to 
                              provide more complete advice to commanders. 
                              5.         The use of a special air transportable isolator for highly infectious 
                              disease patients could be considered for nations possessing such equipment. 
                              However, the use of such equipment requires a large number of personnel and 
                              this form of aeromedical evacuation can only be used infrequently and for the 
                              occasional patient.                 It cannot be seen as a routine means of aeromedical 
                              evacuation. 
                                                                                           7-2                                 Edition A Version 1

                                   MIXED (CIVILIAN/MILITARY) ASSETS IN MILITARY MASS CASUALTY 
                                                                                    SCENARIOS 
                              8.1.       AIM 
                              The aim of this Chapter is to explain and describe how a military-civilian AE 
                              system may be used within an ongoing NATO operation to handle military mass 
                              casualty situations. 
                              8.2.       CONSIDERATIONS 
                              1.         Aeromedical evacuation is crucial during many types of NATO 
                              operations.           Strategic AE function is a national responsibility for each troop-
                              contributing nation (TCN), therefore, each TCN has to secure capacity and 
                              capability of AE, civilian or military, for mass casualty incidents.                                            TCNs may 
                              cooperate to establish this function on a bi- or multi-lateral level. 
                              2.         Civil assets may be used to augment military AE capability in five ways: 
                                         a.         Civil aircraft assets with military medical crew. 
                                         b.         Civil aircraft assets with civilian medical crew. 
                                         c.         Civil aircraft assets with mixed civilian-military medical crew. 
                                         d.         Military aircraft assets with civilian medical crew. 
                                         e.         Military aircraft assets with mixed civilian-military medical crew. 
                              3.         Chapter 3 describes the various levels of dependency for patients being 
                              aeromedically evacuated.                     While some civil capability may exist for all patient 
                              categories, in an effort to decompress military medical capability on the ground, 
                              and to facilitate patient regulation, the following should be considered: 
                                         a.         Patients categorized as Dependency 1 or 2 require assets with 
                                                    intensive care capability.                   This is best met using dedicated and 
                                                    established AE systems, preferably military. 
                                         b.         Patients assessed as Dependency 3 or 4 may be aeromedically 
                                                    evacuated using civil assets with medical crew and equipment 
                                                    complying with the requirements described in Chapters 4 and 5 
                                                    and as determined by the needs of the patients. 
                                                                                           8-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                              4.         When contracting civil assets for aeromedical evacuation, the following 
                              operational and medical issues must be considered: 
                                         a.         The contract must ensure that contracted capabilities meet the 
                                                    requirements of this publication.                            Specifically, electro-medical 
                                                    equipment used in AE must be cleared by the relevant national 
                                                    authority for the aircraft on which it is used. 
                                         b.         National legal/medico-legal responsibilities and liabilities must be 
                                                    established.          Specifically, the contractor must be able to verify the 
                                                    quality and level of training of medical crews. 
                                         c.         Responsibility for providing the medical crews and aeromedical 
                                                    equipment. 
                                         d.         Standard Operating Procedures for initiating, planning and 
                                                    executing the AE operations.

                                                    Treatment and Evacuation Treatment and Cause of Death of 
                                                    Patients. 
                                         h.         Routines for briefing medical crew on patient history and status. 
                                         i.         Responsibilities of military and civil authorities at points of 
                                                    embarkation and disembarkation. 
                              5.         During an AE operation, the treatment of patients should be secured at 
                              the appropriate level depending on patient history and status.                                                      It is the 
                              responsibility of the physicians at the sending medical facility in coordination 
                              with the validating flight surgeon at the Aeromedical Evacuation Coordination 
                              Centre to identify the required level of medical care during transfer.                                                      The 
                              medical care during the AE operation is provided by the AE crew – it is, 
                              therefore, crucial that patients’ medical needs are clearly stated and considered 
                              when deciding what type of AE assets are to be used. 
                                                                                           8-2                                 Edition A Version 1
